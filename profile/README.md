## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - Generally this organization is for keeping track of courses I teach, the projects we build, and sample code

🌈 Contribution guidelines - Likely you would be a student registered in a course I am teaching, or an alum building on work you completed in the courses! But general help and requests for collaborations are always welcome!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
