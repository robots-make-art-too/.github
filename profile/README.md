## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - Generally this organization is for keeping track of courses I teach, the projects we build, and sample code

🌈 Contribution guidelines - Likely you would be a student registered in a course I am teaching, or an alum building on work you completed in the courses! But general help and requests for collaborations are always welcome!
